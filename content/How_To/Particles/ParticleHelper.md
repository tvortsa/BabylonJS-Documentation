PG_TITLE: How To Use the Particle Helper
---

# Introducing the Particle Helper
Starting with Babylon.js v3.3, you can now use the Particle Helper to create complex particle systems without having to deal with individual properties.

To use the Particle Helper, you only need to know the name of the effect and then call this code:

```
BABYLON.ParticleHelper.CreateAsync("sun", scene).then((set) => {
    set.start();
});
```

This will create regular particle systems. If you want to use GPU particle systems instead, just call this code:

```
BABYLON.ParticleHelper.CreateAsync("sun", scene, true).then((set) => {
    set.start();
});
```

You can find a demo here: https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#1VGT5D#2

## ParticleSystemSet

When calling `BABYLON.ParticleHelper.CreateAsync()`, you will get a Promise that will resolve returning a `ParticleSystemSet`.
This class can be used with the following properties and functions:

* `emitterNode`: Use this property to get the transform node used as emitter by the particle systems
* `start(emitter)`: Call this function to start all particle systems associated with the current set. You can use the optional parameter to overwrite the emitter
* `dispose()`: Call this function to stop and clear all particle systems

You can also get the list of particle systems used by the set with `set.systems`.


## Available effects

Each effect can be described using a json file like this one: https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/blob/master/assets/particles/systems/sun.json
