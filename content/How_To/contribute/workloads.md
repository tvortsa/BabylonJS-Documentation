# Workloads
By default, the build process will generate code for all classes in the repo. For size reasons you may want to strip out some classes that you are not using.

## Custom builds

To do so, you will have to edit the config.json file from /tools/gulp folder.

This file starts like this:

```
    "build": {
        "filename": "babylon.max.js",
        "minFilename": "babylon.js",
        "minWorkerFilename": "babylon.worker.js",
        "declarationFilename": "babylon.d.ts",
        "declarationModuleFilename": "babylon.module.d.ts",
        "outputDirectory": "../../dist/preview release",
        "srcOutputDirectory": "../../src/",
        "currentConfig": "all"
    },
    "buildConfigurations": {
        "all": [
                ...
        ],
        "minimal": [
            "meshBuilder",
            "freeCamera",
            "hemisphericLight"
        ],
        "360Viewer": [
            "arcRotateCamera",
            "hemisphericLight",
            "meshBuilder",
            "picking",
            "backgroundMaterial",
            "videoDome"
        ]  
    },
    "workloads" :
    {
```    

You can see inside the `buildConfigurations` bucket that two configurations are defined: `all` and `minimal`.
A configuration is an array of workloads. Workloads are sets of file, shaders and dependencies. They define a set of work. You can use then to cherry pick only features that you want to use.

For instance the `minimal` configuration only contains the following workloards: `meshBuilder`, `freeCamera`, `hemisphericLight`.

You can change the active configuration by settings the `build.currentConfig` value (set to `all` by default).

| 360Viewer | 188 |
