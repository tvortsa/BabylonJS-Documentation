# How to start

## Introduction
Development Ecosystem in Web is becoming more and more difficult to chose due to the diversity of tools and Frameworks. If you want to get started on BJS, we chose to support a set of tools to simplify your first steps with it. This can also be use on a daily basis for your contribution development.

This document will introduce everything from the tools installation to debugging in BJS. This is meant to be OS agnostic, allowing users to develop the same way on Windows, Mac and Linux. 

*NOTE:* If you're looking to contribute to the Documentation, please use [this guide](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/16365-contributing-to-documentation-101/). 

## Pre-Requisite

### Git Client
If you do not already have a git client, you can install one from [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

*Hint:* if you are developing on Windows, I would recommand using [cmder](http://cmder.net/) as your command line host (the full install is worth it and embed a git client).

![cmder](/img/how_to/howToStart/cmder.png)

Once done, you can open a command line and configure git globally:
```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

### NodeJS and NPM 
The second step is to install nodejs and its package manager. These will be your best friends and help you achieve a X-platform dev experience: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Typescript and Gulp  
Once both git and npm are installed in your environment, please globally install both major BJS dev dependencies by launching those command lines:
1. npm install -g typescript
2. npm install -g gulp

They are respectively for dealing with the Typescript language and the build tools used in the project.

*Hint:* if you are developing on Windows, I would recommand using [cmder](http://cmder.net/) as your command line host (the full install is worth it).

### Visual Studio Code
Trying to be Open Source and OS agnostic, we chose to support VSCode which offers the quickest approach to get started. For those amongst you with another choice, it is worth giving it a try to see what it brings as the heavy integration has been managed for you.

You can install VSCode from their site: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Once installed, a few pluggins will help you having the best experience. You can search for them in the extension tab (Ctrl+Shift+d):
1. Debugger for Chrome as well as the chrome browser.
2. Shader language support for VS Code (syntax highlighting and autocompletion in glsl shader)
3. [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julianchen.babylon-js-viewer) can be used to display the content of a babylon file directly in vscode. It can be useful if you want to quickly check if your artist did a good job with object and their names :)

Finally, I would recommend adding a few shortcuts to your environment. Follow the [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/customization/keybindings#_customizing-shortcuts):
 1. To configure keyboard shortcuts the way you want, go to the menu under File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts. (Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts on Mac)
 2. In the left side, add:
 ```
// Place your key bindings in this file to overwrite the defaults
[
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+s",         "command": "workbench.action.files.saveFiles" },
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+k",         "command": "workbench.action.tasks.terminate" },
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+t",         "command": "workbench.action.tasks.test" },
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+l",         "command": "workbench.action.tasks.showLog" },
{ "key": "ctrl+shift+alt+r",         "command": "workbench.action.tasks.runTask" }
]
```

This will make the main commands quicker to access. Do not hesitate to adapt the bindings to your preferences.

## Installation
As during our local build, firefox is used during our integration tests step. It is strongly advised to install it.

You are now all setup, and only a few steps from debugging. You now need to clone the project from github. Open a command line, move to the folder that will contain bjs and type:
```
git clone https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js.git
```

You could clone your own fork of babylon in the same way by using its own git repository url:
```
git clone {yourrepo}
git remote add upstream https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js.git
```
Adding the upstream will help syncing back your fork.

Then navigate to the BJS folder and install the BJS required node modules through npm:
```
cd BabylonJS/Tools/Gulp
npm install
gulp
```

The gulp command needs to be launched once to bootstrap your local files.

The /dist folder continuously gets updated after building causing noise when checking git's status and these files should not be modifiied by pull requests. To ignore these files you can run the following in your command prompt:
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged "Playground/babylon.d.txt"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/babylon.d.ts"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/babylon.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/babylon.max.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/babylon.worker.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/customConfigurations/minimalGLTFViewer/babylon.d.ts"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/customConfigurations/minimalGLTFViewer/babylon.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/customConfigurations/minimalGLTFViewer/babylon.max.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/customConfigurations/minimalGLTFViewer/es6.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/es6.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/loaders/babylon.glTF2FileLoader.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/loaders/babylon.glTF2FileLoader.min.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/loaders/babylon.glTFFileLoader.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/loaders/babylon.glTFFileLoader.min.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/loaders/babylonjs.loaders.min.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/typedocValidationBaseline.json"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/viewer/babylon.viewer.js"
git update-index --assume-unchanged "dist/preview release/viewer/babylon.viewer.max.js"
```
You are good to go !!!

## Debug
Open VSCode on the newly created BabylonJS folder and launch the test task. To do so, 2 solutions:
1. Use the shortcut to run a task (Ctrl+Shift+p) and begin to type `run`. You should be on `run` task, so hit enter.
2. Open a terminal on Tools/Gulp and run `gulp run`

This has been hijacked for your convenience and will watch all the files you are modifying as well as web serve the files for development purpose. As you noticed in the VSCode installation you can easily hook it up to a keyboard shortcut.

Once the task is launched you can kill it by repsectively:
1. Use the shortcut to run a task (Ctrl+Shift+p) and begin to type terminate. You should be on Terminate Running Task task, so hit enter.
2. Use the shortcut you previously bind to the command in your keyboard bindings (default is Ctrl+Alt+Shift+k)
3. In the terminal press `Ctrl+c`

In the VSCode debug tab, chose the section you want to debug and launch the debugger (the test task needs to be running).

This will debug all the TS and js in chrome and stop on your breakpoints setup in those files in VSCode. This debugs all the code from src, materialsLibrary, procceduralTexturesLibrary, postprocessLibrary...

*Hint*: If another chrome session is already running on remote debug on port 9222 the debugger will fail to attach as the port is already open. You will have to close the other remote debug first. 

The main entry points in BJS are:

1. [Sandbox]("http://localhost:1338/sandbox/index-local.html"): [http://localhost:1338/sandbox/index-local.html](http://localhost:1338/sandbox/index-local.html)
2. [Playground]("http://localhost:1338/Playground/index-local.html"):  [http://localhost:1338/Playground/index-local.html](http://localhost:1338/Playground/index-local.html)
3. [Materials Library]("http://localhost:1338/materialsLibrary/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/materialsLibrary/index.html](http://localhost:1338/materialsLibrary/index.html)
4. [Post Process Library]("http://localhost:1338/postProcessLibrary/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/postProcessLibrary/index.html](http://localhost:1338/postProcessLibrary/index.html)
5. [Procedural Textures Library]("http://localhost:1338/proceduralTexturesLibrary/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/proceduralTexturesLibrary/index.html](http://localhost:1338/proceduralTexturesLibrary/index.html)
6. [Inspector]("http://localhost:1338/inspector/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/inspector/index.html](http://localhost:1338/inspector/index.html)
7. [Local Dev]("http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html](http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html)
8. [Build validation]("http://localhost:1338/tests/validation/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/tests/validation/index.html](http://localhost:1338/tests/validation/index.html)

All of those allow debugging the source code of bjs directly from typescript.

![debug](/img/how_to/howToStart/debug.png)

If you wish to test the fully compiled version instead of independant files simply append ?dist=true in the different urls.

You could also test against the minified version by choosing ?dist=min. this will work on all the referenced URLs.

## Edit Code
Once the test task (gulp run) has been launched through gulp or VSCode, any TS or shader file save will automatically rebuild the associated js. Simply reload your browser to see the changes in effect and begin to debug your new code.

*Hint*: You may need to refresh the code before adding back a new breakpoint. 

## Local Dev
In order to simplify the quick testing and development, you can copy paste playgrounds code in the devLocal/src/index.js file. The entire devLocal/src folder is git ignored and is meant to be your local test folder.

You can launch it through: [Local Dev]("http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html"): [http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html](http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html)

From there you can easily add breakpoint in your playground js or the BJS ts files for debugging.

Adding in the url ?dist=true or ?dist=min will help testing against the built files.

As using only one test file is annoying, feel free to add index.1.js, index.2.js... and so on. In VSCode, copy pasting the file in the same folder results in creating the next available slot in the folder e.g. copy pasting index.1.js will create index.2.js.

To launch index.{number}.js simply append in the url sample={number} so for launching index.3.js against the unminified released files, use: http://localhost:1338/localDev/index.html?dist=true&sample=3

This should help playing and debugging locally.

## Validate changes
As part of your testing process, it is highly recommended to launch the build validator: http://localhost:1338/tests/validation/index.htm.
It will run several scenes against a reference image to detect any visual changes.

## Gulp
The main gulpfile in Tools/Gulp contains a lot of helpfull tasks. So first open a terminal (Ctrl+`) in VScode or your favorite terminal. Navigate to the Tools/Gulp folder and you are ready to run the following commands.

* `gulp run` launches all the watchers and a web server (this is map to the build command in VSCode Ctrl+Shift+b).
* `gulp webserver` launches the webserver only.
* `gulp watch` launches the watchers only.
* `gulp typescript-all` generates all the distribution files in the dist/preview release folder 
* `gulp typescript` generates the BJS distribution files.
* `gulp typescript-libraries` generates all the library (materials, procedural textures...) files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp loaders` generates all the loaders files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp serializers` generates all the serializers files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp materialsLibrary` generates all the materials files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp proceduralTexturesLibrary` generates all the procedural textures files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp postProcessesLibrary` generates all the post processes files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp inspector` generates the inspector files in the dist/preview release folder.
* `gulp deployLocalDev` regenerates your localDev/src/index.js from the template.

## Adding files
In order to add more files to the codebase you will have to edit the config.json file from /tools/gulp folder.
If you add files to the core, you will need to reference them in the core [workload](https://doc.babylonjs.com/how_to/workloads). Do not forget to also reference your shaders and shaderIncludes.

If you plan to add files to a satellite project (like the postProcessLibrary), you will have to add them to the associated entry, like this one for the postProcessLibrary:
```
 "postProcessesLibrary": {
        "libraries": [
            {
                "files": [
                    "../../postProcessLibrary/src/asciiArt/babylon.asciiArtPostProcess.ts"
                ],
                "shaderFiles": [
                    "../../postProcessLibrary/src/asciiArt/asciiart.fragment.fx"
                ],
                "output": "babylon.asciiArtPostProcess.js"
            },
            {
                "files": [
                    "../../postProcessLibrary/src/digitalRain/babylon.digitalRainPostProcess.ts"
                ],
                "shaderFiles": [
                    "../../postProcessLibrary/src/digitalRain/digitalrain.fragment.fx"
                ],
                "output": "babylon.digitalRainPostProcess.js"
            }
        ]
}
```
