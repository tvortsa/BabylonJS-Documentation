# Adding materials

The editor provides a tool to preview, edit and add materials.

This includes:
* Standard and PBR materials
* All materials from the BabylonJS materials library

To access the tool, just click on the toolbar **View -> Materials Viewer...**.
Then, you can select a material and modify it using the **Inspector**.
To assign a material to a mesh in the scene, you can drag'n'drop the material on the mesh. Or, change the material value in the **Inspector** once you have selected a mesh.
